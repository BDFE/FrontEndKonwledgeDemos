            OSIRIS-REx is an unprecedented effort to investigate what makes up asteroids like Bennu and how they move
            through space. But, as those leaping particles show, the mission has already delivered a few surprises.

            “We’ve been studying asteroids for a long time and no one had ever seen this phenomenon before—these little
            particles getting shot off of the surface,” said Daniel Scheeres, distinguished professor in the Ann and
            H.J. Smead Department of Aerospace Engineering Sciences. He leads the radio science team for OSIRIS-REx
            along with CU Boulder’s Jay McMahon.
